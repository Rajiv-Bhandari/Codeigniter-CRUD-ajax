CRUD Operations in CodeIgniter
=============================

This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations implemented in CodeIgniter, a powerful PHP framework. Using Ajax, these operations are performed asynchronously, providing a seamless user experience without the need for page reloads. The application allows users to manage car models, including adding new models, viewing existing ones, editing their details, and deleting them. Each operation is handled through dedicated controller methods, which interact with the database using CodeIgniter's built-in functionalities. With its intuitive interface and efficient backend processing, this project showcases the power and simplicity of CodeIgniter for building dynamic web applications.
